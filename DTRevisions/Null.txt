Null: null value to a variable in js is to signify 
"Intentional absence of any object value"
"Or, clearing the variable's reference to any object that it may be holding before"

1. Clearing a reference: 
>> For Memory Management
>>lets say variable held a reference to large object, 
you are done with the object, in this case, setting variabe to
null is good practice 
>> it signals js engine's garbage collector that memory
previously occupied by that object can be safely reclaimed,
there is no one referencing it. 

**Basically clearing memory**

2. Assigning null value to var for future object Assignment

>> when you want to declare a variable, and knowing that 
you will later assign an object(can be DOM element, database connection or user profile) to it

>> so for now, assign it null value.
>> null: means, variable is meant to hold an object but
currently its deliverately empty (temporary)

3. Also to differentiate from the "undefined" value
undefined: you declare a variable but didnot initialise it
>> value gets the undefined value. 

Now, instead of leaving the var unintialised, you assign it a null value
>> this means I know that the var exists, and I intentionally assigned it the value null, empty

so that in future, you can make it assign a object reference or any value
