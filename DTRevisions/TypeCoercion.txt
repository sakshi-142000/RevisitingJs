Type Coercion and Loose Comparison (==)

automatic conversion of data types that happen 
when using operators (the == operator)
that require operands of same type. 

The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm

When using a==b, js engine follows the below algo:
1. if a and b are of same type:  check A===B
2. if one of null and other is undefined, return true
3. if one if number, other is string, compare string to number and then compare
4. if one if boolean, conver boolean to number and then compare the results. 



Therefore, we have Strict Comparison(===) in js

Strict comparison (===) does not perform type coercion.
