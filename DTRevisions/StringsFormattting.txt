Ways to handle Strings in JS

1. Template Literals:
    - Use backticks (``) to create multi-line strings and embed expressions.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      let name = "John";
      let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!
      Welcome to the world of JavaScript.`;
      console.log(greeting);
      ```

2. JS String Delimiters:

    - Single Quotes (' '): Used for defining strings.
      Example: `let singleQuoteString = 'Hello World';`
    - Double Quotes (" "): Also used for defining strings.
      Example: `let doubleQuoteString = "Hello World";`
    - Backticks (` `): Used for template literals, allowing multi-line strings and expression embedding.
      Example: `let backtickString = `Hello ${name}`;`

3. Multi-line Strings in JavaScript
The key difference is how JavaScript handles the physical newline character 
(when you press the Enter key) within the string definition itself.

1. With Single or Double Quotes (' or ")
If you try to press Enter (insert a physical newline) 
while defining a string with single or double quotes, 
JavaScript's parser throws a SyntaxError.❌ Incorrect (Will Throw an Error)JavaScript// This will cause a SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL (or similar)
let quoteString = "This is the first line. 
This is the second line."; 

Why the Error?
The JS specification dictates that 
single and double quotes must enclose a string on a single line of code. 
The parser sees the newline character as an unexpected break in the string definition.✅ 
Correct Way with Quotes (Requires \n)
To achieve a multi-line output using quotes, 
you must explicitly use the escape sequence for a newline: 
let correctQuoteString = "This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.";

console.log(correctQuoteString);
/*
Output:
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
*/


2. With Backticks (Template Literals)
Template literals were introduced to solve this exact problem. 
They inherently recognize the physical newline character 
entered by the developer as part of the string content.
Correct Way with Backticks (Natural) 
backtickString = `This is the first line.
This is the second line.
    And this line is indented.`;

console.log(backtickString);
/*
Output:
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
    And this line is indented.
*/
